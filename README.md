SpoonCow Blog for Google App Engine
===================================

A basic blog that will end up hosted on GAE on http://spooncow.com.

I am using this as a way of learning Python and GAE.

I am focusing initially on three post types:

- regular blog posts : sequentially ordered
- pages : fixed pages such as about, home, faq etc.
- cartoon posts : consists of an image and associated text
- video posts : a link to a hosted video (may add self hosting via blobstore later)

Possible future post types:

- gallery
- custom code
